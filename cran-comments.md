## Release summary

This is the first attempted CRAN release of janeaustenr, and my first submission to CRAN.

## Test environments
* Local OS X install: R 3.2.4
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on Travis-CI): R 3.2.4
* Win-builder: R-devel and R-release

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* There was a note about possibly invalid URLs for the Project Gutenberg URLs in the .Rd files because Project Gutenberg blocks automated traffic, and about possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION (Austen's at 2:30 and 6:34, Northanger at 8:32) but these are the correct spellings.
