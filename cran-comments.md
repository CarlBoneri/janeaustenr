## Release summary

This is the first attempted CRAN release of janeaustenr, and my first submission to CRAN.

* Ubuntu 14.04 (on Travis-CI): R 3.2.4, R-devel
* Win-builder: R-devel and R-release

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 2 notes

There is 1 note about me being a new maintainer.

There is 1 note about non-ASCII, marked UTF-8 strings; there are 2 in the data sets.

* `mansfieldpark[14652]` has a British pound symbol.
* `persuasion[7066]` has an e with an accent grave (in the word "arrang√®")

I believe it would be inappropriate to change these as these are the published texts, so I would like to keep them as is.

Also, there was a message about possibly invalid URLs for the Project Gutenberg URLs in the .Rd files, and about possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION ("Austen's" at 2:30 and 6:34, "Northanger" at 8:32).

* Project Gutenberg blocks automated traffic, which caused the issue with the possibly invalid URLs.
* Those words are spelled correctly.
